# speakeasy-chat

Simple two person chat with account system. Based on another project which fell through. A lot of the code is legacy only, pertaining to features in the original project. Additionally, code in many places needs to be cleaned up and commented. Most importantly it is functional. 

## Requirements

Node.js
MySQL database running on the same server. 
Chats folder in the same directory as backend.js
